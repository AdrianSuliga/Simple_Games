# Guessing game

In this game you are trying to guess a number from given array of natural numbers. After each guess computer can give you 3 types of feedback:

1) This number is too big,

2) This number is too small,

3) You guessed it!

Update:

  As of today, the programm shows you title screen with a button which begins the game. After beginning you choose a range which the computer is going to choose from.

Update:

  You may adjust this range by using sliders connected to lcd displays or by typing numbers from you keyboard. I implemented validation to those inputs, it is impossible
to enter negative numbers and I prevented the situation when last number in range is smaller than the first one. Unfortunately, programm cannot handle situation when 
someone types words instead of numbers (yet).
  After you've entered input game shows you chosen range. Mechanics of drawing number from this range isn't implemented.
