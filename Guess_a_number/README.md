# Guessing game

In this game you are trying to guess a number from an array of natural numbers. After each guess computer can give you 3 types of feedback:

1) This number is too big,

2) This number is too small,

3) You guessed it!

Descrtiption:

When you open this game, it shows a title screen. In simple labels I explained the rules of the game, there are also buttons which begin or quit the game.

After beginning, player can choose a range by using sliders or simply typing numbers. I added some form of validation. Users cannot enter characters, floating point
numbers nor negative numbers as input. If one tries to do it, this application shows an error message.

Having chosen the range, user may now attempt to guess one number which computer chose from said range.

After successfully guessing a number user can begin next round or quit.

Things to improve:

My application is not responsive. Today, I am starting working on improving it. In order to fix it, I had to remake everything so description which you have read in "Description" section will soon be outdated (I will fix it too, do not worry).
