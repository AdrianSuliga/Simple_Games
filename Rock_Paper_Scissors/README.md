# Rock, Paper, Scissors

It is a simple game where you play rock, paper, scissors against a computer. You choose your item by clicking on corresponding label with an image, user can also choose how many rounds he wants to play. After finishing all the rounds, user can receive three types of output:
- You won (show total score)
- You lost (show total score)
- Game ended in a draw (show total score)

## Progress
I am working on title screen where player is informed about the rules and can choose number of rounds that he wants to play.
